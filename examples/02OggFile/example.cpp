  // We specify the TINYOAL_ISPLAYING flag when we create the Audio instance, which causes it to immediately
  // start playing. We also specify TINYOAL_COPYINTOMEMORY when we load the OGG file, which causes the entire
  // OGG file to be copied into RAM and the file released. You can only have a single instance of a file-based
  // resource playing at any time, so if you need multiple instances, copy it into memory.
