  // we pass in TINYOAL_FILETYPE_MP3 to force TinyOAL to attempt loading the file as an MP3. mpg123 can then skip the

  // It is possible to get a nearly seamless looping MP3 file, but it requires some extra effort. This file was 
  // originally a lossless wav which was then looped. The loop point in that lossless version was recorded at sample
  // #1524096. Then, this version was saved out to an MP3. mpTrim.exe was used to chop off the very last frame from
  // the end of the mp3. This method is hit and miss, so use OGG if you want true seamless looping. Unlike last time,
  // this time we're passing the loop sample # into the resource itself, which will then be used by any audio 
  // instance derived from that source. However, if the file in question has embedded metadata that contains a loop
  // point, that value will override whatever you pass into the constructor here. If this is a problem, you can
  // always set the loop point in the audio resource itself, or set it on each individual instance.
